- Java Is both Compiled-One time-and Interpreted.
- JVM + Libraries = JRE + Compiler + Utilities = JDK

- **Java is Networked, Simplfy Network programming**


**Not a Comparison but a General remeber, Static Methods can only access static variables of the class, Because it's created as soon as the class is created**
